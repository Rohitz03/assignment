        What RCB needs?!?</strong></h1>

One of the premium IPL teams, but yet to win the league. Featured and continues to feature top class players but no success as a team yet. Excellent and loyal fans but very little to cheer on.
Yet again they have started the 2019 campaign with 4 straight losses.
What is that they are doing wrong? What RCB needs?

        <strong>1.What Went Wrong ?</strong>
    </header>
<aside>
    <strong>The Auction -</strong> This is something which can be associated with the team almost in all seasons. 
They never buy smart, this season too the same thing happened. 
They don't have depth in the squad because they overpaid for 1/2 players who aren't hitting  the mark. 
And when you look around for options there aren't many. 
May be that's why Kohli emphasize on standard playing XI, but 2/3 changes is warranted after 4 losses.
</aside>

    <strong>The Local Boys -</strong>IPL is a global phenomenon, its a platform where people move to different places and identify where they belong.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahendra_Singh_Dhoni">Dhoni</a> is the best example, entire 
<a href="https://www.chennaisuperkings.com/CSK_WEB/index.html">CSK</a> fan base and the state accepted him as their 
own and he reciprocated the love, 
same can be applied to Kohli too with <a href="https://www.royalchallengers.com/">RCB</a>, similarly Bravo, Pollard, Gayle, Warner, all these are the players who the fans rejoice as their own.
But if we move down from the icons, the local guys are the ones that really define the success of a team and RCB does not have good local core.
Many players who played or should have played for them are having successful stints in other teams.
</aside>
<aside>
    <strong>Kohli & ABD -</strong> Iconic players, larger than life, unquestionable talents. 
But when they fail, RCB fail, no one else steps up and its partly tied up with the 
#2.

    <strong>2.What needs to change?</strong>
</aside>
<aside>
    <strong>The Combination -</strong> Its clear that the team hasn't found their right  combination yet. 
And with 4 losses upfront they don't have much buffer left. 
The proper playing XI should be identified and the worst thing is they haven't experimented much yet. 
So they have to hit bulls eye in the next game.
</aside>
<aside>
    <strong>Pressure off Icons -</strong> More than the team the single handed match winning ability of  Kohli and ABD is completely taken 
out of the equation because they take it all upon themselves and expose themselves too early.  
According to me they should bat at 4 and 5 respectively and send Dube or Parthiv or Washington in early to have some 
runs on board and allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli">Kohli</a> and ABD to come in and play their  game without pressure. 
Stoinis coming to team adds that extra punch towards the end, so Kohli and ABD can really be the backbone till they 
find their rhythm and once they do Kohli can move up.
</aside>
<aside>
    <strong>Bowlers -</strong> Chahal cannot  take 10 wickets. It doesn't matter if Umesh and Siraj bowl well, 
but if they cant take wickets RCB cant win matches. Its time to bring in Southee or Coulter Nile. 
To me Coulter Nile is a very good option upfront and towards the end too. And they need to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Sundar">Washington Sundar</a>, 
considering he is an international player and can bowl in power plays too, am not sure why he is sitting in the bench.
